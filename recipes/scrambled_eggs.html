    <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
    <p>Whether you're starting off the morning, or having a late night meal, scrambled eggs are the quintessential backbone of any breakfast. Served with cheese, hot sauce, salsa, or on their own, these creamy and delicious scrambled eggs will have you scrambling for how such a delicious recipe can be so simple.</p>

    <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong></ul>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>Pinch of kosher salt. (Table salt works I prommy)</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons of whole milk</li>
<li> 1 tablespoon unsalted butter.</li>

    <ol><strong>Procedure</strong></ol>
    <li>Whisk the eggs, salt, pepper, and milk together until light and foamy.</li>
    <li>Add the butter to a 10- to 12-inch nonstick skillet and put it over high heat. When the butter bubbles, about 1 minute, pour the eggs straight into the middle of the pan, which will force the butter to the edges, where it's needed. </li>
    <li>Scramble the eggs: Stir slowly with a rubber or silicone spatula. As soon as curds (big soft lumps) of egg begin to form, drop the heat to low, and shift from stirring to folding the curds over on themselves while gently shaking the pan with the other hand. </li>
    <li>As soon as no more liquidous egg is running around the pan, kill the heat, and gently transfer the scramble to a warmed plate. Let the eggs rest for 1 minute to finish cooking before serving. </li>
