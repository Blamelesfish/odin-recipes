<h1>Valentine's Spicy Peanut Noodles</h1>
<p>A mouthwatering combination of spicy, sweet, salty, and nutty, this dish is best prepared on a cold night with friends. Serves 4-6 people.</p>
<h2> <strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
<ul><strong>Sauce Ingredients</strong>
<li>1/2 cup peanut butter. Chunky or creamy doesn't matter, choose whichever you prefer.</li>
<li>1/2 cup of soy sauce.</li>
<li>14 oz. coconut milk. Just go for the canned stuff.</li>
<li>1/2 cup agave nectar.</li>
<li>1/4 cup sirracha sauce.</li>
<li>1/4 cup lime juice.</li>
<li>Garlic Powder. I use garlic powder instead of raw garlic mainly so it integrates better into the sauce.</li>
<li>Red Chili Flakes.</li>
<li>Crushed Pepper.</li>
</ul>

<ul><strong>Dry Ingredients</strong>
<li>A 16 oz package of rice noodles.</li>
<li>A few stalks of Celery. Slice these pretty thin.</li>
<li>5-6 carrots, sliced at an angle around 1/8 of an inch thin.</li>
<li>1 Block of Extra firm Tofu, diced into one inch cubes.</li>
<li>A whole Onion, diced.</li>
<li>A head of garlic, diced finely. I usually go with two or three because I'm a freak.</li>
<li>One red and one green bell pepper, diced.</li>
<li>Some broccoli, if you want.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ul>  

<ul><strong>Procedure</strong>
<li>Before getting anything else ready, submerge the dry noodles in hot water.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees, and oil a pan for the tofu. Put the tofu in the oven when it's preheated. Cook until each side is crispy, rotating it every five minutes.</li>
<li>Oil a large pan, then start sauteeing the carrots on medium high heat.</li>
<li>If cooking broccoli, when the carrots have started to soften a bit, add the brocooli. Make sure you're moving the veggies frequently to prevent burning.</li>
<li>While the carrots and broccoli are cooking, mix the Sauce Ingredients in a blender, then blend until it reaches a thick, liquid consistency.</li>
<li>Once the carrots and broccoli have softened, add the bell peppers.</li>
<li>If the vegetables are all softened before the tofu is done, just take the veggies off the heat for a while.</li>
<li>Once the tofu is done, add that and the softened noodles to the vegetables and sautee until the noodles are soft and the tofu is hot. Add the sauce at this point.</li>
<li>You're now ready to serve!</li>
</ul>
